BATTLESHIP RAHHHHHH - understanding 1d and 2d arrays in java :P

ways to declare arrays (1d)
    int[] box;
    int[] box = new int[10];
    int[] box = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11}; only done @ point of declaration, starts w initial values, can modify values but not spaces in array

ways to declare arrays (2d)
    box[r][c] - row focused, rows first collums second
      c o l
    r 1 2 3
    o 4 5 6
    w 7 8 9
